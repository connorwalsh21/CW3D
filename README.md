# CW3D

CW3D is an OpenGL based game engine created by Connor Walsh.

## Installation

Simply download and import the solution into Visual Studio.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/connorwalsh21/CW3D.git
```

## Use

If you just want to use it, then all you need is the CW3D.exe and the resources folder. The code detects if the resources folder is in the same directory as the exe, so as long as they are in the same directory, it will work.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

## Resources
Seeing as this is a very low level engine using OpenGL, there are a ton of include files that are required. I do not own these and all rights go to their original creators.
